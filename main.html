		<p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom,
			[1] is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
			(plants of the division Angiospermae). 
			Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ 
			sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. 
			Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce 
			gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. </p>
